Password Strength Checker — GUI-Based Python Tool
This project is part of my cybersecurity internship at SkillCraft Technology, where I was tasked with building a Python-based tool that evaluates the strength of user passwords.

The tool uses regular expressions (RegEx) to analyze a password’s complexity based on:

Length (minimum 8 characters)
Uppercase & lowercase letters
Numbers
Special symbols
It provides real-time visual feedback through a clean Tkinter GUI, showing both the overall strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong) and actionable improvement suggestions.

 Tech Stack used
Language: Python
Library: Tkinter, re (RegEx)
Platform: Linux (developed & tested)

 Features

Interactive GUI interface
Password visible while typing (for testing)
Color-coded strength indicator
Detailed feedback suggestions
